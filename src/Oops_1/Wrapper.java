//1. Final Variables: A final variable can only be initialized once, and its value cannot be changed later. It is often used to define constants.
//2. Final Methods: A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
//3. Final Classes: A final class cannot be subclassed or inherited.
//                  final does not imply immutability; an objectâ€™s state can still be changed, but its reference cannot be reassigned.
